# Common and Shared FSx Across Two EC2 Windows Server Instances

## Description
This project demonstrates how to set up a shared **Amazon FSx** file system between two **EC2 Windows Server instances**, enabling seamless file sharing and centralized storage management.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up FSx, ensure you have the following:

- âœ… An **AWS account**
- âœ… Two **EC2 Windows Server instances**
- âœ… **Amazon FSx for Windows File Server**
- âœ… **AWS CLI** installed and configured

## Architecture Diagram (Optional)
*(Add a diagram showing how EC2 instances connect to FSx.)*

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Amazon FSx File System
1. Navigate to the **AWS FSx Console**.
2. Choose **FSx for Windows File Server**.
3. Configure networking, security groups, and permissions.
4. Deploy the FSx file system and note the **DNS Name**.

### Step 2: Configure EC2 Instances
1. Launch **two Windows Server EC2 instances**.
2. Ensure they are in the **same VPC and security group**.
3. Open **Remote Desktop Connection (RDP)** to access the instances.

### Step 3: Mount FSx to EC2
1. Open **PowerShell** on each EC2 instance.
2. Run the following command to map the shared drive:

   ```powershell
   net use X: \\<FSx-DNS-Name>\share
Verify shared storage access on both instances.

Usage
ðŸ“‚ Store and access shared files between EC2 instances.

ðŸš€ Ideal for applications requiring centralized storage.

Security Best Practices
ðŸ”’ Restrict FSx access using security groups.

ðŸ“Œ Enable AWS Backup for FSx.

ðŸ”‘ Use IAM policies for access control.
